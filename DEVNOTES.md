# Quarter Close — Dev Notes

## Workflow

- **Feedback comes via chat** — the developer sends feedback conversationally
- **I file GitHub Issues** for each separate item (label appropriately: bug, ui, gameplay, feature, phase2)
- **File issue FIRST, then code** — don't implement without an issue
- **Reference issues in commits** when fixing them
- **Propose designs before implementing** — wait for explicit approval on big mechanics
- **Repo:** https://github.com/Kpa-clawbot/quarter-close (public)
- **Collaborators:** KpaBap (admin), Kpa-clawbot (owner)
- **Live URL:** https://kpa-clawbot.github.io/quarter-close/ (GitHub Pages, master branch)
- **Analytics:** https://quarter-close.goatcounter.com (GoatCounter, loads only on github.io)

## Labels

- `bug` — something's broken
- `ui` — visual/styling tweaks  
- `gameplay` — balance, mechanics, feel
- `feature` — new stuff for current phase
- `phase2` — ideas to park for later

## Tech Stack

- Pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no build step
- localStorage for saves (backward-compatible with fallback defaults)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages (public repo required for free plan)
- Local dev server: `nohup python3 -m http.server 8090 &` (must use nohup, not bare exec)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — page structure + OG meta tags for social embeds
- `style.css` — Excel-accurate styling
- `game.js` — game engine (~2400 lines)
- `preview.png` — OG embed preview image (1200×630, Office 2003 splash style)
- `DESIGN.md` — full game vision (all phases)
- `PHASE1.md` — current phase scope & spec
- `DEVNOTES.md` — this file

## Key Design Decisions

- Game title in browser tab: "Q4 Financials - Operations.xlsx - Quarter Close"
- Boss Key = Esc (toggles to empty spreadsheet, game keeps running)
- Ctrl+S = save (intercepts browser save)
- No sound (stealth at work)
- Revenue sources unlock sequentially
- Progression: Click to collect → Automate → Upgrade
- Offline progress capped at 8 hours, automated sources only
- **Fixed 1 day/tick** — variable time scale was tried and scrapped (time compression cancels revenue growth dopamine)
- **4 career arcs**: Tech Startup, Food Empire, E-Commerce Hustler, Generic Entrepreneur — same core mechanics, different flavor text
- **Per-tick earnings should always go UP** — any mechanic causing sudden drops kills the fun
- **Max buttons styled as blue links** (spreadsheet hyperlink look), not colored buttons
- **IRS escalation over random dice** — debt compounds with 1% daily interest, stages escalate over 180 game-days
- **Depreciation for tax** — capital spending deducted over 4 quarters, not immediately (prevents gaming tax day)
- **All event toasts auto-expire in 10s** — last button (worst option) gets red countdown fill, auto-fires
- **IRS tax toasts not closable but auto-expire** — `closable: false` hides ✕ button, but no `expiresMs: 0` so the 10s countdown on Ignore still works. Earnings modal uses `expiresMs: 0` because game is paused during it.
- **Finance Dept = Smart CFO, not guidance override** — Finance Dept doesn't let the player pick guidance mid-quarter (that's cheesing). Instead, each level has an AI algorithm that picks guidance automatically. Lv1 = random intern. Lv2 = trend-based CFO. Lv3 = elite analyst. Player can switch between owned levels anytime but can't manually set guidance when Finance Dept is active.
- **RE economy: 10 × log10** — multiplier was briefly changed to 100000× (broken) then reverted. At $80B quarterly revenue: ~109 base RE, ~200 typical, ~980 max per quarter. Board Room prices: 500 to 25,000 RE.
- **Old inflated RE capped on load** — saves with >100K RE get reset to 0 (from pre-nerf formula bug)
- **Late-game tiers stay grounded** — no sci-fi/absurd names. Tech companies ARE the endgame.
- **Fractal market noise** — volatility itself is a random walk (0.05-1.0), three noise frequencies (fast/slow/shock), creating realistic calm→chaotic chart patterns
- **Earnings modals never auto-expire** — like IRS toasts, they use `expiresMs: 0` because guidance selection is an important decision
- **Earnings and tax are independent cycles** — both fire every 90 game-days but use separate counters (`lastEarningsDay` vs `lastQuarterDay`), so they don't interfere
- **Stock price is derived, not stored** — `getStockPrice()` = `getCompanyValuation() / sharesOutstanding`, recalculated each tick
- **`_earningsMultiplier` persists stock reactions** — discrete jumps from earnings beats/misses layer on top of fractal noise via a multiplier on valuation

## Architecture Notes

### Tax Panel DOM Rebuild
- `updateTaxPanel()` rebuilds innerHTML for P&L + tax liability + IR sections
- Called every tick from `updateDisplay()`, but uses hash-based diffing (`_lastTaxPanelHash`) to skip rebuilds when data hasn't changed
- Settle buttons and guidance buttons use event delegation on `#tax-panel` (stable parent survives innerHTML rebuilds)
- **Lesson:** When innerHTML is rebuilt frequently, NEVER rely on button stability — use event delegation AND minimize unnecessary rebuilds

### Event Toast System
- `showEventToast()` renders desktop notification-style popup with buttons
- `expiresMs` controls auto-expire (default 10000, 0 to disable)
- Last button gets countdown overlay (CSS `toast-btn-countdown` animation)
- `eventToastTimer` global cleared on click/dismiss
- Events can use `type: 'dynamic'` with `setup()` function for content based on game state

### Valuation Chart
- Canvas-rendered, `#4472C4` Excel blue line, gray gridlines, gradient fill
- Formula: `Cash + (Annual Revenue × baseMult × growthMod × noise) - taxLiabilities`
- Post-IPO: valuation × `_earningsMultiplier` (stock price reactions from earnings)
- Draggable + resizable floating overlay, positioned right of Rev/yr column
- `_volState` tracks volatility random walk for fractal noise
- Max 200 data points, sampled every tick, persisted in save/load

### Phase 2.1: IPO + Earnings System
- **IPO trigger**: `checkIPOTrigger()` fires when `getCompanyValuation() >= $5T`, shows non-expiring toast with accept/decline
- **IPO execution**: `executeIPO()` sets `isPublic=true`, initializes 1B shares, sets default In-Line guidance, records `lastEarningsDay` and `ipoStockPriceStart`
- **IR section**: Rendered inside `updateTaxPanel()` (below P&L, above Tax Liability). Shows quarter, days left, revenue vs target (with inline progress bar), guidance buttons, streak, stock price + QTD%, retained earnings
- **Guidance buttons**: 4 inline buttons (🛡️ 📊 🎯 🔥) in the IR grid section, active one highlighted with `ir-active` class. Click handler via event delegation on `#tax-panel`
- **Earnings processing**: `processEarnings()` fires every 90 game-days post-IPO. Compares `earningsQuarterRevenue` to `guidanceTarget`, calculates beat/miss margin, applies stock change via `_earningsMultiplier`, awards RE on beats, updates analyst baseline + streak
- **Earnings revenue tracking**: `trackEarningsRevenue(amount)` called wherever revenue is added (gameTick, miniTask, goldenCell, big client events, automation collection). Keeps `earningsQuarterRevenue` in sync without duplicating revenue
- **Retained Earnings formula**: `Math.floor(qRevenue × 0.001 × guidanceMult × marginBonus × streakMult)` — miss = 0 RE. Accumulates but not spendable until Phase 2.2
- **Analyst ratchet**: `analystBaseline` starts at 1.0, moves ×1.05 on beat, ×0.97 on miss, ×1.15 on 3+ consecutive beats, ×0.90 on 2+ consecutive misses. Affects projected revenue calculation for next quarter's guidance target
- **Stock price display**: Two places — `#stock-price-cell` in the cash row (cell B2), and `#stock-ticker` in the status bar (gold colored)
- **Debug**: 🧪 IPO button calls `forceIPO()` — triggers IPO regardless of valuation
- **Save/load**: All new fields have fallback defaults (`|| false`, `|| 0`, `|| null`, `|| 1.0`). `_earningsMultiplier` also persisted.

### Save Compatibility
- All new fields use fallback defaults: `data.field || 0`, `data.array || []`
- No need to clear saves between code changes
- Only need New Game to switch arcs

### Multi-Slot Save System (v0.5.0)
- **localStorage keys**: `quarterClose_slots` (metadata array), `quarterClose_activeSlot` (int), `quarterClose_slot_N` (save data per slot)
- **Slot IDs start at 1** (not 0)
- **Migration**: Old `quarterClose_save` key auto-migrates to slot 1 on first load with new code
- **`buildSaveData()`**: Extracted shared function used by saveGame, Save As, and Export
- **SHA-256 checksum**: `crypto.subtle.digest()` with salt `qc_2026_s4lt` — anti-casual-editing, warns but allows load on mismatch
- **File format**: `{ version, name, exportedAt, checksum, data: {...gameState} }`
- **Import**: Always creates a new slot (never overwrites existing)
- **New Game flow**: Creates new slot, saves current game first, prompts for name via `_pendingSlotName` mechanism
- **Storage tracking**: `JSON.stringify(data).length * 2` bytes (UTF-16) per slot, shown in Manage Saves modal

### Playback Controls (v0.5.1)
- **Toolbar location**: Pause + speed buttons in `.toolbar-playback` group, right-aligned in `#toolbar` via `margin-left: auto`
- **Auto-pause**: `menuPause()` / `menuResume()` with `_menuPausedGame` flag — pauses on menu/modal open, resumes on close, won't unpause if player manually paused first
- **Speed toggle**: `cycleSlowdown()` cycles `gameState.tickSlowdown` through [1, 2, 4, 8] with text labels ['1×', '½×', '¼×', '⅛×']
- **Timescale display**: `updateTimescaleDisplay()` shared function updates `#status-timescale` for all speed states
- **Revenue rates**: Status bar /sec /min /hr divide by `tickSlowdown` to show real-time rates

### Decorative UI Elements (v0.5.1)
- **`.decorative` class**: Applied to non-functional toolbar buttons and menu items
- **Toolbar buttons**: `opacity: 0.35`, `pointer-events: none` — visually faded and non-clickable
- **Menu items**: `opacity: 0.45`, `cursor: default` — slightly less faded (still readable)
- **Tooltips**: All elements have `title` attribute; decorative ones say "Decorative"

### Font Size System (v0.5.1)
- **Root CSS**: `html { font-size: clamp(14px, 1.8vw, 18px); }` — auto viewport scaling
- **FONT_SIZES array**: `[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26]`
- **Default index**: 6 (= 18px, matching CSS clamp max)
- **`initZoom()`**: Only overrides CSS if user has stored preference; otherwise CSS clamp handles it
- **RE display pre-IPO**: Uses `visibility: hidden` (NOT `display: none`) to preserve grid cell positions

### Phase 2.1: IPO + Earnings System
- **IPO trigger**: `checkIPOTrigger()` fires when `getCompanyValuation() >= 5e12`, shows accept/decline toast (expiresMs: 0)
- **Stock price**: `getStockPrice() = getCompanyValuation() / sharesOutstanding` — displayed in status bar and IR section
- **Earnings multiplier**: `gameState._earningsMultiplier` (persisted) — multiplicative factor on valuation, adjusted by earnings beats/misses. This creates discrete stock price jumps on top of fractal noise.
- **Guidance system**: 4 levels (conservative/in-line/ambitious/aggressive) with different risk/reward. Target = `totalRevPerTick() × 90 × analystBaseline × guidancePct`. Buttons use event delegation on `#tax-panel`.
- **Earnings quarter**: Independent 90-day cycle tracked by `lastEarningsDay` — separate from tax `lastQuarterDay`. Both can coincide but don't interfere.
- **Earnings revenue tracking**: `trackEarningsRevenue(amount)` called from all revenue sources (automated, clicks, mini-tasks, golden cells, event effects). Accumulates in `earningsQuarterRevenue`.
- **IR section**: Rendered inside `updateTaxPanel()` between P&L and Tax Liability sections. Uses same hash-based DOM diffing pattern. Guidance buttons use `data-guidance` attribute with delegated click handler.
- **Analyst ratchet**: `analystBaseline` multiplier shifts projected revenue baseline. Beats increase (+5%, or +15% on 3+ streak), misses decrease (-3%, or -10% on 2+ streak).
- **Retained Earnings**: Integer currency, earned on beats only. Formula: `quarterRev × 0.001 × guidanceMult × marginBonus × streakMult`. Displayed but not spendable until Phase 2.2.
- **Debug**: `forceIPO()` function, 🧪 IPO button next to existing debug buttons.

### Phase 2.2: Board Room (RE Prestige Shop)
- **Board Room tab**: New sheet tab (post-IPO only) that replaces the Operations grid with a purchasable upgrades grid. Uses `switchTab()` to toggle between views.
- **Tab switching**: `gameState.activeTab` tracks current view. Operations shows revenue-rows/tax-panel/filler-rows, Board Room shows board-room-rows. Both use `display: contents` wrapper pattern.
- **10 upgrades**: Finance Dept (3 levels), Revenue Multiplier (3 tiers), Lobbyist, Tax Haven, Analyst Relations, Golden Parachute. Defined in `BOARD_ROOM_UPGRADES` array.
- **Upgrade effects**: 
  - `getBoardRoomRevMultiplier()` — applied in `totalRevPerTick()`, `totalAnnualRev()`, and `gameTick()` per-source loop
  - `getBoardRoomTaxRate()` — applied in `processQuarterlyTax()` and P&L display
  - `getFinanceDeptLevel()` — checked in `processEarnings()` to skip modal and auto-set guidance
  - Analyst Relations — halves the ratchet multiplier in `processEarnings()` beat path
  - Golden Parachute — consumed in seizure handler, blocks asset seizure
- **Board Room rendering**: `buildBoardRoom()` with hash-based change detection (`_lastBoardRoomHash`). Buy buttons use event delegation on `#board-room-rows`.
- **Save/load**: `boardRoomPurchases` persisted as a map of upgrade IDs to counts. Loaded with `|| {}` fallback.
- **Debug note**: Revenue multiplier applies at tick level (per-source in gameTick loop) AND in totalRevPerTick/totalAnnualRev. This is intentional — both paths need it for consistency.

### Growth Initiative & RE Quality of Life
- **Growth Initiative**: Repeatable Board Room upgrade, +2% rev per purchase (stacks as `1.02^N`). Base cost 50 RE, scales 10% per purchase via `scalingCost` property on upgrade definition. `getUpgradeCost()` helper calculates actual cost based on owned count.
- **RE stats in IR section**: `lastQuarterRE` tracked in gameState, set in `processEarnings()`. IR row shows "Last Q: +N" and ETA to cheapest affordable upgrade with real time: "Growth Initiative in ~2Q (3m)".
- **ETA logic**: Filters available upgrades (not maxed, prereqs met), sorts by `getUpgradeCost()`, picks cheapest. Shows quarters needed + real time (quarters × 90s).
- **Design rationale**: RE progression was too slow — at $5.5T/yr revenue, log10 formula gives ~121 RE/Q. Saving for 500 RE Finance Dept Lv1 takes 4+ quarters with nothing to spend on. Growth Initiative gives immediate value every quarter and creates a flywheel: more rev → more RE → more GI → more rev.

### CPA on Retainer (Tax Automation)
- **Board Room upgrade**, 750 RE, category Tax. Completely eliminates IRS toast interruptions.
- **processQuarterlyTax()**: CPA check runs before any toast logic. If can afford → auto-pay + status bar message + return. If can't afford → auto-defer (create debt silently) + return. If taxOwed ≤ 0 → silent return (no zero-tax toast either).
- **processTaxDebts()**: CPA auto-settle runs before escalation loop. Iterates debts in reverse (safe splice), pays any affordable debt. Status bar shows "📋 CPA settled Q2 tax debt ($X)".
- **Status bar feedback**: 4-second messages: "📋 CPA paid Q3 taxes ($2.4B)" or "📋 CPA deferred Q3 taxes — insufficient funds" or "📋 CPA settled Q2 tax debt ($1.8B)".

### Prestige Tiers (★ Restructure)
- Post-IPO only, automated sources only. Button appears in action3 column (replaces plain AUTO badge with ⚡ + ★ button).
- `prestigeLevel` on source state — each level multiplies baseRate by `Math.pow(10, prestigeLevel)`.
- `prestigeCost(source)` = `50 × (1 + tier) × 3^level`. Tier 0 starts at 50 RE, tier 11 at 600 RE. Each subsequent prestige on same source costs 3×.
- `restructureSource(index)` — deducts RE, increments `prestigeLevel`, forces tax panel hash reset (RE changed), updates display.
- Gold ★N tag in name cell. Gold-styled button (`btn-prestige` CSS).
- **Design rationale**: Low tiers are cheap to restructure (a lemonade stand is simpler to restructure than a megacorp). But 10× on a megacorp is worth more, so players prioritize high tiers — then fill in low tiers when they have spare RE.

### R&D Breakthroughs
- Random event added to EVENTS array (generate-style). Picks random unlocked source with employees.
- `breakthroughMult` on source state (default 1). Each breakthrough doubles it.
- Two choices: Implement (×2 to that dept) or File Patent (+5% cash).
- Green 🔬×N tag in name cell when breakthroughMult > 1.
- Both `sourceRevPerTick()` and `sourceAnnualRev()` multiply by `breakthroughMult`.

### Board Room Category Grouping
- `buildBoardRoom()` now groups `BOARD_ROOM_UPGRADES` by category, renders category header rows with emoji + underline.
- `categoryOrder` array controls display order: Finance, Revenue, Tax, Investor, Protection.
- Upgrades sorted by `getUpgradeCost()` ascending within each group.
- `totalUpgradeRows` counter used for accurate filler row calculation.

### P&L Section Removed
- Entire P&L section (Revenue, Expenses, Depreciation, Taxes Paid, Taxable Income, Net Income) removed from `updateTaxPanel()`.
- Was redundant with tax panel and revenue breakdown bar.
- IR section now starts immediately after panel unhide.

### Clicking Mechanics (v0.3.0)
- **Feature Toggle System**: Data menu → "Game Options..." modal. Three checkboxes: Close the Deal, Overtime, Management Focus (all default ON). Stored in `gameState.featureToggles`, gated by `isFeatureEnabled(key)`.
- **Overtime**: "⏰ Overtime" row below source rows. "Push It" button gives 5s of revenue × diminishing factor `1/(1+clicks×0.15)`. Resets each quarter. Shows click count, next amount, efficiency %. Hidden when disabled or no revenue.
- **Close the Deal**: Random enterprise contract toasts every 3-8 min. Rapid-click "✍️ Sign" button to collect signatures (10-30 required, scales with `log10(annualRev)`). 12s timer. Reward = 30-60s of revenue. Fun client names (Hooli, Initech, etc). Separate cooldown from random events.
- **Management Focus**: Click dept name to add focus (max 10 = +50%). Each point = +5% via `focusMult` in `sourceRevPerTick()`/`sourceAnnualRev()`. Decays 1 point per 10s idle. Transient (not saved — resets on load). Visual: 🎯N tag, green flash on click.
- **All three count toward quarterly revenue + earnings tracking.**

### Bug: Prestige/Breakthrough Not Persisting
- `prestigeLevel` and `breakthroughMult` were being loaded from save but never written to the save object's `sources.map()`.
- Fix: added both fields to serialization in `saveGame()`. Commit `72ac758`.

### Column Width Stabilization (#54)
- Old `max-content` grid columns shifted with content changes ($1K→$1B, button labels).
- `fr` units filled entire screen — wrong approach.
- Fixed pixel widths + `1fr` on last column = stable like real Excel.
- `grid-template-columns: 40px 200px 120px 100px 190px 160px 130px 95px 1fr`
- Added `min-width: 0` to `.cell` for flex overflow handling.

### Rows 1-2 Revamp
- Row 1 = stats dashboard: Cash, $amount, $/day, Total Rev/yr label+value, stock price in H.
- Row 2 = column headers: DEPARTMENT | Staff | Rev/day | Hire | Upgrade | Actions | Rev/yr.
- Action columns (D/E/F) now labeled.
- Stock price moved from B to H.

### Help Screen Revamp
- Tabbed layout with 5 tabs: Basics, Active Play, Events & Taxes, Board Room, Tips
- Wider modal (720px vs 520px, was single-column 520px)
- Two-column grid (`.help-columns`) within each tab for scannable layout
- `showHelpTab(tabId)` JS function switches tabs, `.help-page.active` shows content
- Board Room split by category (CFO, Revenue, Tax, Restructure, R&D, Stock)
- Strategy tips added in Tips tab

### Dynamic Grid Columns (Board Room vs Operations)
- `#grid-container.boardroom-layout` CSS class applied by `switchTab()`
- Operations: `40px 200px 120px 100px 190px 160px 130px 120px 1fr`
- Board Room: `40px 200px 120px 100px 120px 280px 130px 120px 1fr` (column E wider for descriptions, D narrower)
- Board Room descriptions stay in column E with full personality text
- **Lesson:** Don't strip flavor text to fit layout — fix the layout instead

### Row 3 Separator Removed
- Invisible 4px separator row caused gap in numbering (1, 2, 4...)
- Removed entirely — departments now start at row 3
- All row number bases changed from 4 to 3

### Earnings & IRS Toast Formatting
- Toast system supports `html: true` option for formatted bodies
- Earnings modal: structured label-value rows (`.er-row`, `.er-label`, `.er-value`)
- IRS toast: same layout — Revenue, Depreciation, Taxable Income, Tax Rate, Tax Owed
- Dividers (`.er-divider`) between sections
- RE highlighted in blue (`.er-re`), tax owed in red, results bold (`.er-result`)
- No more text crammed into `\n`-separated strings

### Close the Deal Cooldown Fix
- Old cooldown: 180-480s (3-8 min) — too long, most players never saw one
- New: 60-180s initial, 90-240s subsequent
- Still requires: feature enabled, toast hidden, `totalRevPerTick() > 0`, `totalPlayTime > 60`

### Streak RE Bonus Visibility
- Beat streak = +10% RE per consecutive beat, capped at 2.0×
- Now shown in IR section: `🔥 3 beats (1.3× RE)`
- And in earnings toast: `🔥 3 consecutive beats (1.3× RE)`

### CFO Selector Layout
- Manual button in column B, numbered level buttons (👶1 📊2 🎩3) in column C
- Was all crammed in column B — didn't fit

### Hover Tooltips on All Buttons
- CFO Manual: "Set earnings guidance yourself each quarter"
- CFO 1/2/3: personality descriptions
- Push It: "Instant cash (5s of revenue). Diminishing returns per quarter."
- Max(N): "Hire/Buy all N you can afford"
- Collect: "Click to collect pending revenue"
- (Existing: 🎯 focus, Hire, Auto, Upgrade, ★ Restructure)

### CFO Logic Rework — Weighted Random Picks
- **Old (broken):** Deterministic threshold math where `projectedRev` cancelled out on both sides. Lv2 was locked to conservative forever because `1 > 0.90 * 1.0 * 1.20` always failed. Bug was tautological math.
- **New:** Context-aware weighted random selection based on streak, analyst baseline, revenue state.
- **Lv2 weights by context:**
  - After 2+ misses: 70% conservative, 25% in-line, 5% ambitious
  - After 1 miss: 40/45/15/0
  - Fresh (streak 0): 20/50/25/5
  - Short beat streak (1-3): 10/35/40/15
  - Long beat streak (4+): 5/20/45/30
  - High analyst baseline (>1.15): +20 conservative, -15 ambitious/aggressive
- **Lv3 weights:** Smarter base distribution + also factors in revenue bonuses/penalties and recognizes long-streak analyst danger
- **Design principle:** CFOs should have personality — sometimes safe, sometimes bold, reacting to context. Not deterministic.

### Revenue vs Target Column Split
- Column C was overflowing with both percentage and dollar values
- Split: C shows percentage (`+15.3%`), D shows raw values (`1.2B / 800M`)

### Focus Icon (🎯)
- Faded 🎯 before dept name on automated departments only
- Tooltip explains the mechanic
- Pulses via CSS animation when focus is active
- Changed condition from `employees > 0` to `state.automated` — focus is a post-automation mechanic

### Stock Price Label
- Changed from `📈 $X` to `Stock: $X` in column H
- Column H widened from 95px to 120px

### Close the Deal — Own Popup (Not a Toast)
- **Problem:** Deals shared the event toast element. If any IRS/earnings/event toast was showing, deals couldn't spawn. With 10s auto-expire on events + IRS toasts that stay until dismissed, deals were starved.
- **Fix:** `#deal-popup` — completely separate UI element with its own HTML, CSS, and drag state.
- Centered on screen (same as event toast), draggable by header, remembers position (`quarterClose_dealPos` in localStorage).
- Red countdown fill on Sign button via `toast-btn-fill` animation.
- Spawn condition no longer checks `event-toast.hidden` — deals fire independently.
- Boss key hides deal popup too.
- `dismissEvent()` no longer clears deal state (they're independent now).

### College Buddy Event Revamp
- **Old:** Lose 1% cash for nothing, or say no for nothing. No decision.
- **New:** Risk 5% cash on a meeting. 40% chance it's a legit side deal (1-3 min of revenue). 60% chance it's an MLM pitch (money gone). Or ghost them for free.
- Actual risk/reward gambling mechanic now.

### Cache Buster Fix
- `game.js` cache buster was stuck at `v=29` while `style.css` was at `v=53`. Previous `sed` commands targeted wrong version numbers and silently failed.
- **Lesson:** Always verify the actual version string in the file before doing sed replacements. Or just use a broader pattern.

### IT-Themed Negative Events (8 new)
Added 8 new IT disaster events with varied mechanics:

| Event | Sender | Effect | Player Choice |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Ransomware | IT Security | Full revenue freeze 30-60s or 15% cash | Pay vs rebuild |
| DDoS Attack | Network Operations | 50% revenue 20-30s | No choice |
| DB Corruption | DBA Team | Random dept offline 15-20s or 3% cash | Fix vs wait |
| Email Server Down | IT Department | Mini-tasks blocked 45-60s | No choice |
| Password Reset | IT Security | 10s full freeze (timed) | No choice |
| Cloud Provider Outage | Status Page | 25% revenue 15-25s | No choice |
| P0 Bug | Engineering Lead | 5% cash hotfix or 50% revenue 60s | Hotfix vs next sprint |
| Laptop Recall | IT Asset Management | 70% revenue 20s | No choice |

**New state fields:**
- `dbOutage: { sourceIndex, until }` — tick-based, zeroes out one dept's revenue in `totalRevPerTick()`
- `miniTaskBlocked: { until }` — checked in `trySpawnMiniTask()`
- Both reset on new game, cleaned up automatically when expired

**DB outage visual:** Affected row gets `.db-outage` class (red tint), rev/day cell shows `💾 OFFLINE 15s` countdown.

### Row 1 Revenue Effect Indicators
The $/day cell in row 1 now color-codes active effects:
- **Power outage:** Red bold `⚡ $0.00/day`
- **Revenue penalty:** Red `$X/day ▼30%` (shows penalty percentage)
- **DB outage:** Orange `$X/day 💾`
- **Revenue bonus:** Green bold `$X/day ▲×5` (shows multiplier)
- Normal: plain text

### Debug Event Trigger (🧪 Event ▾)
- Dropdown button in status bar next to IRS/5×/IPO debug buttons
- Lists all events, click to fire instantly
- Handles dynamic events (generate/setup patterns) with fallback labels

### Bug Fixes
- `arc.names[]` doesn't exist — all 4 references fixed to `arc.sources[i].name`
- R&D Breakthrough `generate()` pattern wasn't handled by `showEvent()` — added handler
- DB Corruption always picked highest-tier dept — changed to random pick
- Dynamic events crashed debug dropdown (no static sender/subject) — added fallbacks
- `dealCooldown=0` caught by `!gameState.dealCooldown` (falsy) — re-initialized cooldown every time it hit zero, preventing deals from ever spawning after the first. Fixed with explicit `=== undefined || === null` check.

### Close the Deal — Spawn Fix
The `!gameState.dealCooldown` guard was a classic JS falsy trap. When cooldown decremented to 0:
1. `!0` → `true` → re-initialize cooldown to 60-180
2. `cooldown > 0` → `true` → decrement
3. Never reaches `spawnDeal()` because step 1 always fires first

Fix: Check `=== undefined || === null` so that `0` falls through to the spawn branch. This was the documented gotcha in memory but it was actually live-broken the whole time.

### Weighted Event System
Events now use weighted random selection instead of uniform. Each event has a `weight` field:
- **Weight 4** (very common): Angry Customer, Password Reset
- **Weight 3** (common): Mom, Email Down, P0 Bug, Big Client
- **Weight 2** (regular): Power Outage, Cloud Outage, Laptop Recall, TikTok, Reddit, News, Forbes, R&D Breakthrough
- **Weight 1** (rare): College Buddy, Ransomware, DDoS, DB Corruption

Total weight: 40. Base chance: 2% per tick. Cooldown: 30-60s (avg 45s). ~1 event per quarter at 1×.

### Event Frequency Multiplier
`EVENT_FREQ_MULT` scales BOTH the random roll chance AND the cooldown timer.
- Slider in Settings: 0× (off) to 10× (absolute mayhem)
- 1× = ~1 event/quarter, 10× = ~10 events/quarter
- Intensity indicators: 1-3× 🔥, 3-6× 💀, 7-10× ☠️
- Persists in save file, resets on new game

### Debug Mode
Debug tools (🧪 buttons) hidden by default. Activate by tapping "💰 Cash" label 7× within 2 seconds. Session-only, resets on page load.

### Number Formatting
Added tiers up to Decillion: K, M, B, T, Q, Qi (1e18), Sx (1e21), Sp (1e24), Oc (1e27), No (1e30), Dc (1e33).

### Department Column
Level/prestige/breakthrough tags right-justified via flexbox. Name left, tags right.

### Known Issues / Phase 2 Candidates

**Late-game stall (post-$Q revenue)**
- CapEx (hires/upgrades) costs more than the revenue it adds at high tiers, reducing valuation
- RE upgrade options run dry — not enough meaningful late-game sinks
- Potential solutions: acquisitions, mega-projects, new prestige layers, expanded Board Room

**Budget normalization (v0.4.2)**
- CTO + COO budget sliders previously allowed combined >100%, causing negative cash
- Fixed with proportional normalization: combined total capped at 100%, both scaled proportionally
- Effective % shown in gold when normalization active; hover shows set vs effective values

**"Ripped from the Headlines" events (v0.4.2)**
- 11 new real-world inspired events added to EVENTS array
- Use `generate` pattern for dynamic content (employee counts, department names, random topics)
- Static events (Healthcare CEO, Bank Collapse) use standard sender/subject/body/actions
- All have `debugLabel` for debug dropdown testing
- Events with employee firing use `Math.max(1, employees - N)` to prevent zeroing out departments
- CEO Health Scare checks `activeCOOLevel` for branching consequence — having COO = less damage
- CEO Tweet has 30% "double down works" chance (Elon energy)
- Short Seller lawsuit has 50% Streisand effect backfire
- Weight 1 for rare events (bank, pandemic, activist, healthcare), weight 2 for moderate (WFH, AI, supply chain, CEO tweet)
